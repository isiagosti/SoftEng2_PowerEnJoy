\subsubsection{Architectural considerations}
We will use the following technologies:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{MySQL}, for the storage of all the information related to both the PowerEnJoy application and the users.
	\item \textbf{Mapping service}, to keep track of the position of both cars and registered users (only the ones who allow it). 
	\item \textbf{PHP}, to build the back-end of the application. 
	\item \textbf{JavaScript, HTML, CSS} and \textbf{Bootstrap}, to create a responsive and well-designed website.
	\item \textbf{PhoneGap}, to create a responsive mobile application. 
	\item Modern browser with JavaScript and AJAX support.
	\item \textbf{Java} for Android and iOS apps, using original SDK.
	\item Internet/Ethernet connection for data communication.
	\item \textbf{SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)}, to transfer emails from a server to another with a point-to-point connection. 
\end{itemize}
