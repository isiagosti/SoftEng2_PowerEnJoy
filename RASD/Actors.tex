\section{ACTORS}
The actors in our system are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{User}: he/she can use the application only to register to the system by filling out a form.
	\item \textbf{Registered user}: he/she already owns a password (that he/she received by email at the moment of the registration) and can log into the system with it. After doing this, he/she can perform various actions:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item View his/her profile and manage his/her personal information.
		\item View current promotions.
		\item Reserve a car inserting a specific address or letting the system track his/her position with the GPS. 
		\item Cancel a reservation.
		\item Report an issue after unlocking the car.
	\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Employee}: he/she can log into the system with a username and a password and then perform various tasks:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item In case a car is broken, an employee will take care of bringing it to a mechanic and, once fixed, he will change the car's "broken" status from true to false.
		\item In case a car is left in a non-safe area, an employee will take care of bringing it to the nearest safe area.
		\item In case a car's battery is running low and the car is not plugged into any power grid, an employee will take care of calling a tow truck to bring the car to the nearest special safe area and then plugging it into the power grid. 
	\end{itemize}
