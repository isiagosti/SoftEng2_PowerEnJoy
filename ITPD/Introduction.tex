\subsection{Purpose and Scope}
The purpose of this document is to describe how we plan to accomplish the integration test, listing all the tests that will be performed on the PowerEnJoy application.

In particular we will describe how the tests will be executed, which components will be tested and in which order, making sure that the requirements listed in the \textit{RASD} are fulfilled without exhibiting unexpected behaviors.
