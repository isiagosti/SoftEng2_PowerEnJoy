\section{INTEGRATION STRATEGY}
\subsection{Entry Criteria}
Specify  the  criteria  that  must  be  met  before  integration  testing  of  specific  elements may begin (e.g., functions must have been unit tested).  
   
\subsection{Elements to be Integrated}
Identify  the  components  to  be  integrated,  refer  to  your  design  document  to  identify such components in a way that is consistent with your design.

\subsection{Integration Testing Strategy}
Describe the integration testing approach (topOdown, bottomOup, functional groupings, etc.) and the rationale for the choosing that approach. 

\subsection{Sequence of Component/Function Integration} NOTE:    The  structure  of  this  section  may  vary  depending  on  the  integration  strategy  you select in Section 2.3; use the structure proposed below as a non mandatory guide.

\subsubsection{Software  Integration  Sequence}
For  each  subsystem,  identify  the  sequence  in  which  the  software  components  will  be  integrated  within  the  subsystem;  relate  this  sequence to any product features that are being built up.  

\subsubsection{Subsystem  Integration  Sequence}  
Identify  the  order  in  which  subsystems  will  be  integrated;  if  you  have  a  single  subsystem,  2.4.1  and  2.4.2  are  to  be  merged  in  a  single section.   
You can refer to Section 2.2 of the test plan example [1] as an example.
